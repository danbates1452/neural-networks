# Neural Networks Project

A third-year university coursework for the entirety of the Neural Networks module at the University of Sussex in 2023.

Abstract:

An investigation into 6 key hyperparameters for the task
of classifying FashionMNIST images. This included an ex-
ploration of the hyperparameters, and a Random Search of
some ranges found to be optimal for maximising accuracy
and minimising loss.
